    <h1 class="name-application">Body mass index (BMI)</h1>
    <p class="text">Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
        The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed
        in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m).The BMI may be
        determined first by measuring its components by means of a weighing scale and a stadiometer.
        The multiplication and division may be carried out directly, by hand or using a calculator.</p>

    <h2>BMI introduction</h2>
    
    <p class="text">The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as
        based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Major adult BMI classifications
        are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9),
        and obese (30 or more).</p>
    <p>BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality,
        with the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.</p>
